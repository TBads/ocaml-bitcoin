1. Overview
===========

OCaml-bitcoin is a library offering an OCaml interface to the official
Bitcoin client API [1].  It works by making JSON-RPC calls over the
network to a running Bitcoin daemon offering the client API.


2. Dependencies
===============

The core library depends solely on Yojson and Ocamlnet's Netstring [2,3].
If you wish to build the auxiliary 'bitcoin_ocsigen' library you will
also need Lwt and the Ocsigen server libraries [4, 5].  If you wish to
build the auxiliary 'bitcoin_ocamlnet' library you will need Ocamlnet's
Netclient [3].


3. Building and installing
==========================

The build system is generated with OASIS [6].  Run 'configure' if
you wish to modify the defaults.  Enter 'make' and 'make install'
to build and install the libraries.  Enter 'make doc' to generate
the API documentation.


4. License
==========

OCaml-bitcoin is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL version 2.1
(with OCaml linking exception).  See LICENSE file for full license text.
